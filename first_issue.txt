## Using GitHub issues
Based on https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github

Issues are used to discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier by:

- Providing everyone (even future team members) with the complete story in one place
- Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#pull-request)
- Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions
- Allowing you to easily pull the right people and teams into a conversation with @-mentions

The goal of this issue is to replace the `secret ingredient` of the file `bda-01-recipe.py` with your most secret ingredient of a vegetable soup recipe.

Steps:
  1. **Create an issue and assign yourself**
    1. Navigate to the Issues tab and press "New issue"
    2. Add a Title like `First issue to be solved` and copy the all the contents of this file into the "Comment" field
    3. On the right side of the screen, under the "Assignees" section, click the gear icon and select yourself
    4. Click **Submit new issue**
    
  2. **Create a branch**
    Creating a branch allows you to make modifications to your project without changing the `main` branch. For that:
    1. Navigate to the Code tab
    2. Click **Branch: main** in the drop-down
    3. In the field, enter `my-first-issue` as name for your branch 
    4. Click **Create branch: <name>** or press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key to create your branch
    
  3. **Commit a file**
    1. Open the file `bda-01-recipe.py` by going to the Code tab and clicking into the file. Then, press the pencil icon.
    2. Replace the `secret ingredient` with yours, for example, pepper
    3. Scroll to the bottom of the page. Then find the "Commit changes" section
    4. In the first field, type a commit message. The commit message should briefly tell contributors about the changes you are introducing to the file.
    5. Click **Commit Changes**
    Rules to live by for commit messages:
        - Don’t end your commit message with a period.
        - Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.
        - Use active voice. For example, "add" instead of "added" and "merge" instead of "merged"
        - Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change
  
  4. **Open a pull request**
    To share your proposed changes, open a pull request. For that:
    1. Navigate to the "Pull requests" tab and click **New pull request**
    2. In the "base repository:" drop-down menu, make sure the "main" branch is selected
    3. In the "compare:" drop-down menu, select `my-first-issue`
    4. When you’ve selected your branch, enter a title for your pull request. For example `Add secret ingredient`
    5. The next field helps you provide a description of the changes you made
    6. Click **Create pull request**
    
  5. **Merge your pull request**
    In real life scenarios, some comments or modifications should be carried out. For shake of simplicity, let's assume that all is correct. 
    1. Click **Merge pull request**
    2. Click **Confirm merge**
    3. Once your branch has been merged, you don't need it anymore. Click **Delete branch**
    4. Check that your secret ingredient was added to the master branch.
    
  6. **Close issue**
    1. Navigate to the Issues tab and select the issue that you have created in step 1
    2. Add a comment if you like and Click **Close issue**
